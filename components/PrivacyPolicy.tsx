                <p className='text-sm md:text-base'>As a California resident, you have the right under the CCPA to make requests regarding your personal information. Specifically, you can request that we provide you with information about the categories of personal information we collect, the sources of that information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom we share or disclose your personal information. <br /><br />
                    Additionally, you can request access to and/or a copy of the personal information we have on file for you, as well as request that we delete certain information we have collected from you. The CCPA also allows you to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, and prohibits us from discriminating against you for exercising your rights under the law. <br /><br />
                    Please be aware that certain information may be exempt from your requests under California law, such as information that we require to provide you with our Services. Furthermore, we will take steps to verify your identity before responding to any requests you make.<br /><br />
                    If you reside in California and would like to exercise your rights under California law, you may contact us via email at info@lightpathrx.com.

However, we do work with third-party providers who offer marketing and advertising services, including interest-based advertising services. These providers may use tags, pixels, cookies, beacons, and other tracking mechanisms to collect your online identifiers. Given the broad definitions of &ldquo;sale&ldquo; and &ldquo;personal information&ldquo; under the CCPA, providing these online identifiers to third parties for marketing and advertising purposes may be deemed a &ldquo;sale.&ldquo; To opt-out of sharing your information with third-party providers for interest-based advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative&lsquo;s Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Alliance&lsquo;s Consumer Opt-Out link, and Your Online Choices. Please keep in mind that these opt-outs are device and browser-based, meaning you will need to opt-out on each of your devices and browsers. For more information, please refer to the Online Analytics and Advertising section above. <br /><br />
                    Under the Shine the Light law, California residents have the right under certain circumstances to request information from us about how we share specific categories of personal information (as defined by the law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
