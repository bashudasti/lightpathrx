                <p className='text-sm md:text-base'>Telehealth involves providing healthcare services using electronic communication, telecommunications, information technology, or other comparable methods to connect a healthcare professional and a patient who are not physically in the same location. Telehealth allows you to access healthcare services from your provider at various locations, including your own home.</p>

                <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-7 mb-3'>Telehealth Usage</h3>
                <p className='text-sm md:text-base'>Telehealth technology allows for the delivery of healthcare services, ranging from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up care, health education, and public health administration. Telehealth serves multiple purposes, such as the electronic transmission of medical records, personal health information, images, sound, and video files between healthcare providers and patients. Additionally, it enables healthcare professionals to store and forward diagnostic images and communicate with patients through audio or video conferencing and/or data communications.</p>

                <p className='text-sm md:text-base mt-4'>To safeguard the confidentiality and security of patients&lsquo; health information and data, we at LIGHT PATH USA LLC Service will employ network and software security protocols across all electronic systems and technologies used to provide telehealth services. In addition, we will implement measures to prevent the corruption of protected health information and data to maintain its integrity, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Patients can be confident that their interactions with healthcare providers will remain confidential and will not be recorded. <br /><br />

                </p>

                <p className='text-sm md:text-base mt-4'>
                    <span className='font-bold text-xl text-heading'>Diagnosis and treatment limitations:</span> Healthcare providers may be unable to diagnose or treat certain medical conditions due to the inability to conduct physical tests and examinations remotely.

                    Understanding Asynchronous Telehealth Asynchronous Telehealth is a type of telehealth service that allows patients to communicate with their healthcare provider through non-real-time methods like email or secure messaging without the need for face-to-face interactions. This method of communication allows healthcare providers to diagnose and consult with patients when real-time communication is not feasible or necessary.<br /><br />
                    LIGHT PATH USA LLC&lsquo;s Approach to Asynchronous Telehealth LIGHT PATH USA LLC offers Asynchronous Telehealth services through its platform, which uses secure and encrypted technology to facilitate non-real-time communication between patients and healthcare providers. <br /><br />

                </p>

                <p className='text-sm md:text-base mt-4'>
                    Asynchronous Telehealth allows patients to receive medical advice and diagnoses from healthcare providers through non-real-time communication, which can save time and reduce the need for in-person visits.<br /><br />
                    With Asynchronous Telehealth, appointments can be attended from any location as long as there is a reliable internet connection, providing patients with greater flexibility and convenience.
                    By clicking &ldquo; AGREE,&ldquo; you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms and conditions of LIGHT PATH USA LLC&lsquo;s Asynchronous Telehealth service. In addition, you are providing your informed consent to participate in the program under the following conditions:<br /><br />
                    Your healthcare provider is responsible for deciding if telehealth treatment is appropriate for your condition and may suggest alternative sources of medical care or treatment.<br /><br />
                    Telehealth services must comply with the same privacy and confidentiality rules as other healthcare services.<br /><br />
                    Your healthcare information can be disclosed to others in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations of your state or region, as well as LIGHT PATH USA LLC&lsquo;s Privacy Policy.<br /><br />
                    You are entitled to access all health and wellness information related to telehealth services in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.<br /><br />
                    You may revoke or withhold your consent at any time by sending an email to info@lightpathrx.com. However, if you do not withdraw your consent, it will be considered renewed for each subsequent telehealth consultation with your healthcare provider.<br /><br />
                    Your healthcare provider is allowed to reveal information related to your telemedicine examination for the purposes of treatment, payment, and healthcare operations.<br /><br />
                    You also authorize your healthcare provider to share information associated with the telehealth examination with LIGHT PATH USA LLC and its subsidiaries.<br /><br />
                    It&lsquo;s crucial to note that there are specific circumstances under which your healthcare information may be shared without your explicit consent, such as:

                </p>
                <p>
                    If medical records are requested by a court order that is deemed legitimate.<br /><br />
                    In situations where there is suspicion of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence, which must be reported.<br /><br />
                    If there is a necessity to prevent or lessen a severe threat to an individual&lsquo;s health or safety.
                    Before agreeing to Asynchronous Telehealth, it&lsquo;s important to consider the potential risks that may arise. Some of these risks include:<br /><br />
                    Technical issues, disruptions, or failures that may result in appointment delays or cancellations, requiring rescheduling with the healthcare provider.<br /><br />
                    Personal health information privacy may be breached if security protocols fail.<br /><br />
                    Healthcare providers may be unable to fully assess a patient&lsquo;s condition without access to their complete medical history.<br /><br />
                    The likelihood of negative outcomes, such as drug interactions and allergic reactions, may increase if healthcare providers do not have access to a patient&lsquo;s complete medical records.<br /><br />
                    Asynchronous telehealth services are not intended for emergency situations, and personal data is not monitored at all times. In the event of a medical emergency, patients should immediately call 911.<br /><br />
                    It&lsquo;s important for patients to understand that when they use telehealth services, the healthcare provider has the authority to make decisions about the care they receive, and there is no guarantee of diagnosis, treatment, or prescription. Additionally, some states may have legal restrictions on the use of Asynchronous Telehealth. If patients agree to use Asynchronous Telehealth, they are accepting the following terms:<br /><br />

                    They have thoroughly reviewed and comprehended the benefits and risks of using telehealth services on the LIGHT PATH USA LLC platform.<br /><br />
                    Asynchronous telehealth consultations are held to the same privacy standards as in-person visits.
                    Asynchronous telehealth may involve the electronic transfer of personal health data to healthcare providers in other areas, which may include those located outside of the patient&lsquo;s state.<br /><br />
                    While the benefits of asynchronous telehealth are expected, there are no guarantees or assurances of the outcomes.<br /><br />
                    Any information provided by patients or healthcare providers via text messaging or other means will be included in the patient&lsquo;s medical record on the LIGHT PATH USA LLC platform.<br /><br />
                    Patients may revoke or withhold their consent at any time by contacting LIGHT PATH USA LLC via email.<br /><br />
                    This consent is not required for a purchase to be made.<br /><br />
                    The healthcare information of patients may be shared in accordance with the LIGHT PATH USA LLC Privacy Policy and the regulations or laws of the state or territory where they are located.<br /><br />
                    In certain circumstances, such as reporting suspected abuse or neglect or when a valid court order is issued for medical records, patients&lsquo; healthcare information may be shared.
