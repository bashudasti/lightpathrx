                            <h5 className='text-2xl sm:text-[34px] leading-tight mb-5 sm:mb-6'>Why does it happen?</h5>
                            <p>Erectile dysfunction, also known as impotence, refers to the condition where a man is unable to achieve or sustain an erection during sexual activity. This occurs when the penile chambers fail to produce and maintain the necessary pressure required for a full erection. Although sexual stimulation is typically enough to initiate an erection, men with ED struggle to maintain rigidity until ejaculation. The condition can stem from a variety of factors, including aging, hypertension, vascular disease, multiple sclerosis, prostate cancer treatments, stress, certain antidepressants, specific spinal cord injuries, and other causes.</p>

                            <p>In the United States, many ED pills are prescribed. Our expert medical advisors helped us determine which ED treatments we should offer through our platform, ranging from highly effective ED as-needed treatments (like Viagra速) to daily ED medications (like Cialis速 generic). In addition to Hims, doctors sometimes prescribe medications such as vardenafil (Levitra速, Staxyn速) and alprostadil, a penile injection that is not available through our platform.</p>
